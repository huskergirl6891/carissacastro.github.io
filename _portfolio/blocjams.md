## Summary

BlocJams is a Spotify-inspired music player built with AngularJS.  This application allows users to view albums and play music, and features a custom control bar to easily change songs or adjust volume.

## Problem

The goal of the project was to create a new website that would display music albums as well as play back songs from the albums.  There were several features that were requested for each part of the application.  A landing page was desired to display the logo and highlight key features.  Users would need the ability to view the entire collection of albums, including a picture of each album cover and basic album information.  The application would also need to play music from each album, as well as have controls for the user to play and pause each song, change songs with next/previous buttons, and adjust the volume of the playback.  The controls would also need to display information about the currently playing song, including the song name, duration, and a timer that updates as the song progresses.
