## Summary

GrammyPlus is an iOS app that allows users to log in to their Instagram account and then displays pictures from their feed in the app.

## Problem

The goal of the project was to create an iOS app that displays a picture from a user's Instagram feed.  Users need to be able to log in and out of their Instagram account, as well as be able to refresh the app to show the most recent picture from their feed.

## Solution

The application was built using Objective-C, and Cocoapods was included to utilize the OAuth2Client service.  The first step of the project was to set up the project as a single view application.  The main area of the view utilized the UIImageView component to display the Instagram feed picture.  An initial image was included within the app so it could display before a user logs into Instagram.   



## Results

The final application met all of the user requirements and worked as intended.  Testing was done throughout the implementation process as new features were added.  

## Conclusion
